# Taxi routing benchmark

This suite contains several example domains `domXX.txt` for the [Taxi Routing assignment](https://www.dc.fi.udc.es/~cabalar/RP/current/ex2.html) together with one possible solution `solXX.txt` for each domain. All domains are solvable and, in fact, allow multiple different solutions. The following table shows the minimum length plan for each domain: note that the length plan is measured in **number of transitions** rather than number of taxi movements.

Example Minimum plan Length
------- -------------------
dom01   8
dom02   9
dom03   9
dom04   20
dom05   14
dom06   19
dom07   27
dom08   22
dom09   12
dom10   23

As an orientation, all solutions provided as examples `solXX.txt` contain minimum-length plans, but additionally, they have been minimized for the number of **taxi movements**, that is, each time some taxi moves one step. The following table shows the number of taxi movements in each example plan:

Plan    Taxi movements
----    --------------
sol01   12
sol02   6
sol03   7
sol04   18
sol05   22
sol06   28
sol07   22
sol08   58
sol09   23
sol10   39
